# Reports Directory

This directory contains test analysis reports generated by TestIQ.

## About Reports

All reports in this directory are **generated by TestIQ commands** and should not be committed to version control (except this README).

## Generated Files

TestIQ generates reports in multiple formats:

- **`*.html`** - Interactive HTML reports with charts and styling
- **`*.csv`** - CSV exports for spreadsheet analysis
- **`*.md`** - Markdown reports for documentation

## Generating Reports

### Using Demo Data

Generate sample reports with testiq's built-in demo command:
```bash
# Run demo and view results (outputs to terminal)
testiq demo

# Generate reports from actual test coverage
testiq analyze coverage.json --format html --output reports/report.html
```

### CLI Commands
```bash
# HTML report
testiq analyze coverage.json --format html --output reports/report.html

# CSV report
testiq analyze coverage.json --format csv --output reports/report.csv

# Markdown report
testiq analyze coverage.json --format markdown --output reports/report.md

# All formats use the same data source for consistency
```

### Python API
```python
from testiq.reporting import HTMLReportGenerator, CSVReportGenerator
from pathlib import Path

# HTML
html_gen = HTMLReportGenerator(finder)
html_gen.generate(Path("reports/report.html"))

# CSV
csv_gen = CSVReportGenerator(finder)
csv_gen.generate_summary(Path("reports/report.csv"))
```

## Git Tracking

This directory structure is tracked by Git, but **all generated report files are ignored** to keep the repository clean. Only this README is tracked.

## Cleanup

To remove all generated reports:
```bash
rm -f reports/*.html reports/*.csv reports/*.md reports/*.json
# This README will remain
```

## Note on Sample Data

TestIQ v0.2.0 and later generates all sample data internally via the `testiq demo` command. All report formats (HTML, CSV, Markdown) use the same underlying data for consistency.

The `.gitkeep` file ensures the directory structure remains.
